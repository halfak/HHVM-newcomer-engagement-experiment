Recent work has shown that changes in performance (specifically, page load times), can have dramatic effects on user engagement[citation needed]. Recently, the platform team at the Wikimedia Foundation has experimented with deployments of HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) a new execution engine for PHP that promises substantial improvements in page load times. This benefit is especially noticeable in the case of logged-in editors since their page loads are generally not served by the varnish caching servers -- and therefore have to be computed upon request. Performance analysis suggests that pages generally load FIXME% faster.

We hypothesize that the type of performance improvement that HHVM provides will result in improved engagement of editors in Wikipedia. In this study we'll specifically focus on new editor engagement.
